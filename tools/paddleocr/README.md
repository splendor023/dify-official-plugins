# PaddleOCR Dify Plugin

## Overview

**[PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) is an industry-leading, production-ready OCR and document AI engine, offering end-to-end solutions from text extraction to intelligent document understanding.** This plugin provides several capabilities from PaddleOCR, including text recognition, document parsing, and more.

## Configuration

### 1. Get the PaddleOCR plugin from Plugin Marketplace

Open the Plugin Marketplace, search for the PaddleOCR plugin, and install it to integrate it with your application.

### 2. Fill in the configuration in Dify

You can get your AI Studio access token from [this page](https://aistudio.baidu.com/index/accessToken).

For each tool provided by the plugin, there is a corresponding API URL. It is required to provide at least one API URL in order to use the PaddleOCR plugin. To obtain the API URL, visit the [PaddleOCR official website](https://aistudio.baidu.com/paddleocr), click the **API** button, choose the example code for the tool you want to use (e.g., *PP-OCRv5*), and copy the `API_URL`. You do not need to provide URLs for all tools—only for those you intend to use.

### 3. Use the plugin

You can use the PaddleOCR plugin in the following application types. 

#### Chatflow / Workflow applications

Both Chatflow and Workflow applications support adding a PaddleOCR tool node.

#### Agent applications

Add a PaddleOCR tool in the Agent application, and then enter commands to call the tool.

The `file` input supports Dify uploaded image/PDF files directly. The plugin converts uploaded files to the base64 payload expected by PaddleOCR. For compatibility with existing workflows, URL and base64 string values are still accepted by the runtime.
